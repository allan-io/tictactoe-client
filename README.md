PLANNING:

I created a wireframe and a few user stories which I tried to follow. My next
step was to create a game board using HTML and SCSS.

Next I was off and running with the codes, thinking back I should have game
planned a little better with how my code was going to be set up and the flow
of it all, but being my first project I believe I did a lot of things backwards.

Anyhow, I created the game logic first in which the program did everything
locally, including checking for winner, if the game was over, and count the
number of games played and whos turn it was.

Later I realized a lot of those features should have been created using the
API data, so I had to find a way to intertwine the my game logic with the
API data.

I cleaned up the look of the game by hiding unecessary buttons and forms
adding background color to winning combinations.

I added some disable and enable click functionality to restric players from
clicking used up squares and before starting a game.



USER STORIES:

User story 1 - I will want to be able to sign up in order to be able to access
the tic tac toe game user interface

User story 2 - I will want to log in to the same username I created before
when coming back to play at a different time, and be able to access my progress.

User story 3 - I will want to be able to know what my score is at all times and
maybe be able to reset it whenever I want to

User story 4 - I will like to know when I win/loose/tie the round

User story 5 - I will want to be able to play again after the current wound is
over

User story 6 - I will want to be able to log out or exit the page and my
progress be saved at all time for later use
